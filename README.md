## Project Description

MediConnect is a web-based telemedicine platform designed to bridge the gap between patients and licensed medical professionals through seamless online consultations. The system allows patients to register, describe their symptoms, browse available doctors by specialty, and initiate real-time chat consultations — all from a single platform.

Doctors can manage their availability status, accept incoming patient consultations, view patient medical history during sessions, and generate downloadable digital prescriptions in PDF format upon completing a consultation. An admin dashboard provides full oversight of the platform, including the ability to approve or reject incoming doctor registration requests, monitor active consultations, and manage all users.

The project was built to address healthcare accessibility challenges — particularly for patients in remote areas who may not have easy access to in-person medical care. It integrates Django Channels and Daphne (ASGI) for real-time WebSocket-powered chat, ensuring smooth and responsive communication between patients and doctors.
